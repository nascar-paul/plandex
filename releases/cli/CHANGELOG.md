## Version 0.8.3
- Add support for new OpenAI models: `gpt-4-turbo` and `gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09`
- Make `gpt-4-turbo` model the new default model for the planner, builder, and auto-continue roles -- in testing it seems to be better at reasoning and significantly less lazy than the previous default for these roles, `gpt-4-turbo-preview` -- any plan that has not previously had its model settings modified will now use `gpt-4-turbo` by default (those that have been modified will need to be updated manually) -- remember that you can always use `plandex set-model` to change models for your plans
- Fix for `set-model` command argument parsing (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/75)
- Fix for panic during plan stream when a file name's length exceeds the terminal width (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/84)
